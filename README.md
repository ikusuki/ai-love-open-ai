### Proof of concept for [Teller Novel blog](https://zenn.dev/p/tellernovel_inc)

#### by [Oskar DÃ­az](https://career.tellernovel.com/313494e3fec843c297d0033263d35942)

This project is a Hono app that connects to OpenAI API for generating image form a prompt sent to the `/api/open-ai/image-generator` endpoint.

Just for testing purposes, it uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as JavaScript runtime.

```
bun install
bun run dev
```
